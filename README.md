# Vanilla Preact App

Vanilla Preact is a barebones starter kit for building preact applications without build or tooling

## Development

To get a local copy of the code, clone it using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/SafdarJamal/vanilla-preact.git
cd vanilla-preact
```

Finally, you need to start a local web server:

[Download Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)

OR

Install `http-server` globally:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

This will install `http-server` globally so that it may be run from the command line.

```
http-server
```
